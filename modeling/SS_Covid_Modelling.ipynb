    "The opening of society during an active Covid19 pandemic means reproductive rate $R_0$ is a function of time $R_0 \\rightarrow R_0(t)$. In an effort to gain insight to possible reopening methods and consequences of demographic stochasticity. As such a model is needed with the ability to paramaterize the spread rate to an observable. It is common to use the confirmed cases as a metric, but historical under reporting during other epidemics makes it unceartain. Instead we will attempt to relate other data such as the number of deaths and the hospitalization data to parameterize $R_0$.\n",

    "Current concensus among medical research suggest that the incubation time for Covid19 has a typical range of $\\tau_inc = \\in [2,14]$ days(CITE). As such we will include the exposed population function. All in all, susceptable $S(t)$, exposed $E(t)$, infectious $I(t)$, removed $R(t)$ persons are going to be tracked. The following assumptions are made regarding changing populations. Any change in *susceptible* population is a result of birth/deaths or exposure to the infection. People catagorized as *exposed* either die of natural causes or enter an *infectious* period. Those that become infectious either recover or die as a result of the virus or by natural cuases. Finally, the *removed* population can only decrease from natural causes.The simplest equations for rates of change in S, E, I, R are below. \n",

    "Above the rates moving people from one category to another are taken to be constant.Eventually, we will add a driving function which varies over time. A list of the variable and thier meaning follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mu$ = *Births/Deaths frequency* $[T^{-1}]$\n",
    "- $\\beta$ = *Contact frequency* $[T^{-1}]$\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ = *Removal frequency* $[T^{-1}]$\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ = *Latent frequncy* $[T^{-1}]$\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ = *Removal frequency* $[T^{-1}]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The only known variable is $\\mu$, found using US cencus population data. The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, relates the contact and  .The other variables must be derived by paramaterizing the rates in terms of reported observables. Additionally, demographic effects can be modelled by introducing a contact driving function. Counter spread measures can be implimented by breaking the pandemic into different timme periods with varying reproduction values or functions.\n",
